Austin loves eating Bratwurst at 11:27pm on Tuesdays.
When he goes to sleep, he makes sure that the Kilmaanlage is at 50 degrees.
But before going to sleep he always eats a whole Doener.
When he wakes up, he always puts on his Lederhose.
At noon he walks through the Biergarten alone.
Because he is on the no fly list at the Flughafen.
But he flies down Hauptstrasse in his BMW.
Then he got surrounded by a group of Porshces and they wanted to race him.
